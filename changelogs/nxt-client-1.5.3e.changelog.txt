This is an experimental release. It is a required update for all testnet nodes,
but is also possible to run on main net.

This update adds the Prunable Tagged Data feature, planned to be enabled at the
voting system block too.


Prunable tagged data are similar to prunable plain messages with no recipient,
but with additional searchable metadata fields added. This feature can be used
for decentralized and trustless distribution of small (up to 42k, including
the metadata) pieces of data, which are by default stored for two weeks only
(24h on testnet), but can optionally be stored longer or indefinitely by some
nodes, and can be verified against the blockchain even after their expiration.

Currently each tagged data can have the following fields, in addition to the
data itself: name (required), description, tags, type, isText, filename.

Name, description and tags are indexed and searchable using Lucene. All data
and metadata is prunable, after pruning only a single 32 byte hash remains.


New APIs:

UploadTaggedData - create and broadcast new tagged data.

ExtendTaggedData - extend the expiration time of already uploaded tagged data.
If the data is still available, only the transaction id is needed. If not,
already pruned data can be resurrected by including (in addition to the
original transaction id) all of its fields too, i.e. name, description, etc.
Anyone can submit an extension, not only the original uploader. Each extend
transaction increases the expiration deadline by two weeks (24 h on testnet).
Extending an existing tagged data from another account does not change the
original submitter account id by which it is indexed and searchable.

VerifyTaggedData - used to verify expired tagged data downloaded from another
node, against the hash in the current blockchain.

SearchTaggedData - full text search on name, tags, and description, optionally
filtered by submitter account.

GetTaggedData - retrieve tagged data by transaction id.

GetAccountTaggedData - retrieve all tagged data submitted by a given account.

GetAllTaggedData - retrieve all existing tagged data.

GetDataTags - returns the distinct tags of all tagged data, with the number
of data having each tag.

GetDataTagsLike - prefix search of data tags.

GetDataTagCount - the total number of distinct tags.

All the Get* and Search* APIs above can only retrieve tagged data that has
not been pruned yet.

There is no client UI support for any of these APIs. It is expected that
specialized third party plugins will be developed for specific tagged data
use cases, depending on file type and target user group.
