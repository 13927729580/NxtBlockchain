API changes:

The timestamp parameter in getAccountTransactionIds and getAccountTransactions
now refers to the timestamp of the block in which the transaction was included
rather than the transaction timestamp itself. Transactions are sorted in
descending order of block timestamp and transaction id, instead of transaction
timestamp. This is so that the sorting matches the order in which transactions
are processed, and because transactions with earlier timestamps may appear in
the blockchain after transactions with later timestamps have already been
processed, thus being unintentionally skipped while navigating the transactions
list by transaction timestamp.

The getAccountTransactionIds and getAccountTransactions requests now accept an
optional numberOfConfirmations parameter, which can be used to retrieve only
transactions with at least numberOfConfirmations number of confirmations.

There are no other changes between 1.2.7 and 1.2.8, so those who rely on the
old behavior of the above APIs can continue to use 1.2.7 for the time being.
