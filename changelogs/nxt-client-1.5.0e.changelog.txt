This is an experimental release for the Voting System and Phasing. It enables
these features on testnet, and is a required update for all testnet nodes.

It is also possible to run this version on main net, but the block at which the
new features will be enabled has not been set yet.


New features:


Voting System.

Voting System API calls:

CreatePoll, CastVote, GetPoll, GetPolls, GetPollResult, GetPollVote, GetPollVotes,
SearchPolls.


Phasing.

Phasing API calls:

ApproveTransaction, GetAccountPendingTransactions, GetAssetPendingTransactions,
GetCurrencyPendingTransactions, GetPhasingPoll, GetPhasingPolls,
GetPhasingPollVote, GetPhasingPollVotes, GetVoterPendingTransactions.


Variable size messages, encrypted messages, digital goods deliveries.


Other new APIs:

GetPlugins - returns a list of all installed plugins.

DumpPeers - returns all active peers of a certain version.

Shutdown - shuts down the server. Takes an optional scan parameter, if true
the derived tables are truncated and a full rescan with validation is scheduled
on next start. The resulting nxt_db folder is smaller, and a node bootstrapped
with this database is going to verify the blockchain and rebuild all derived
tables on start. While this ensures validity of the blockchain and all tables,
it cannot verify that this is the current consensus blockchain and not a fork,
therefore providing such a database for download is still not trustless.


Changed APIs:

CreateTransaction - to facilitate debugging and to allow preparing transaction
bytes and json even for transactions that are currently invalid, if broadcast
parameter is false, all relevant transaction fields (json, bytes, hash, etc)
are still included in the result even in the case of invalid transaction.
If broadcast=true, those fields are returned only in case of successful
transaction broadcast, otherwise only the error messages are returned.
This change affects all APIs that end up creating a new transaction.

GetConstants - in addition to adding the new transaction types and subtypes,
and the voting models, the format of the resulting json has been changed.

Added optional timestamp parameter to getExchanges and getTrades.

Added optional account parameter and pagination support to getCurrencyFounders.

Always include errorCode and errorDescription in some API results that only had
an error field in case of an error.

Limit number of records returned by all APIs that support pagination to
nxt.maxAPIRecords at a time (default 100), unless the admin password is
provided or is not needed.

AddPeer adds an isNewlyAdded boolean to the returned peer json, indicating
whether the peer was not already known.


Other important changes:

Fixed transaction ordering in AE order matching to always be by transaction
index instead of by id, to take effect after Voting System Block.

Enforce nxt.adminPassword if set, even if the APIServer is listening on
localhost only.

Added nxt.ignorePeerAnnouncedAddress and nxt.cjdnsOnly properties, relevant
only for cjdns users or multihomed nodes.

Default initial peers are now stored in nxt.defaultPeers and
nxt.testnetDefaultPeers instead of being populated by NxtDbVersion on database
creation.

This release requires Java 8 and will not run or compile with Java 7.

Updated Jetty to version 9.2.10 and Bouncy Castle to version 1.52. If unpacking
on top of a previous installation, delete the old lib folder first.

This release will perform a database upgrade with a full rescan on first start.
