Fixed incorrect guaranteed balance bug in getAccountLessors API.

Added getAccountBlockCount API returning number of forged blocks for an account.

Added includeCounts parameter to the getAssets API, to avoid getting trades,
accounts, and transfers counts, if not needed.

Cache hallmarked peer account balances to reduce number of database calls.

Fixed decryption of purchased DGS goods. Fixed missing DGS purchase feedbacks.

Added a hideDelisted parameter to the getDGSGoods API, default false. If true,
delisted goods are not included in the results. This parameter has effect only
if inStockOnly=false, as delisted goods are considered not to be in stock.

UI bugfixes and improvements. Added themes settings and a corporate theme.
Hide fee input when sending NXT in basic mode, and set to the minimum fee.

Improved the http://localhost:7876/test page interface, allow custom API call
selection, syntax highlighting of the response JSON.

Added getAccountAssets API request, returning account asset balances for the
specified account. If an asset parameter is also specified, only return balance
for that asset. Unlike the getAccount API, this request can also take a height
parameter, to return asset balance as of that height.

Added getAssetAccountCount API request, returning number of accounts holding
the specified asset, again with optional height parameter.
