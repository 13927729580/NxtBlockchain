This is an experimental bugfix release. It is a mandatory update for testnet
nodes.

Accounts under phasing only control are not allowed to create or join
shufflings, or start shufflers.

Added includeShufflingInfo parameter to getShufflers, to allow retrieving
shuffling details too with the same request.

The deleteAccountProperty API has been fixed to accept both recipient and
setter parameters, to be able to delete properties set to the account by
another account.

For consistency with setAccountProperty and deleteAccountProperty, the
getAccountProperties API account parameter has been renamed to recipient.
The account owner is also identified as recipient in the JSON fields of
the properties returned.

Added getAvailableToBuy and getAvailableToSell Monetary System APIs, to allow
calculating the rate required in order to completely fill an exchange request,
or the maximum available currency units or NXT amount considering the current
market offers.

Added Account Properties UI.

Account Control UI improvements.

This release will do a blockchain rescan on testnet only, deleting blocks
after height 487511.
