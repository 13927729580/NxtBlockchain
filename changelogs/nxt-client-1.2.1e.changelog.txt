Multiple bugfixes in DGS and Alias Transfer transaction validation. Restricted
some types of alias and DGS transactions to one per alias / DGS purchase per
block.

Improved handling of IPv6 addresses.

Improved the http://localhost:7876/test interface by adding support for tagging
of API requests in multiple categories. All http API requests are now classified
under separate tabs for easier navigation.

Reduced startup time by running loading of peers and initial blockchain scanning
in parallel.

To improve database performance, transactions that do not have a recipient now
have null instead of the genesis account id as recipient in the transactions
table. Such transactions will also not have a recipient field in their JSON.

Added support for pagination to the getAccountTransactionIds API.

Added getAccountTransactions API returning the full transactions json.

Refresh peer info for already connected peers every hour.

Call setReuseAddress(true) for all jetty ServerConnectors.

Refactoring of transaction attachment handling. Added support for transaction
versions and global options. Transactions will switch to version 1 at DGS block.

Added Message and EncryptedMessage attachments that can be attached to any
transaction types, and can have either text or binary content. All APIs that
create a new transaction now accept additional parameters to allow attaching
a Message or EncryptedMessage (or both). This removes the need for creating
new transaction types for encrypted messages or payments with messages.

After DGS milestone block, Asset Transfer transactions can no longer have a
"comment" field. Switch to using a plain text "message" attachment instead.

Added transaction attachment versioning. Transactions of version 1 and later
will have a version field in the attachment too, which allows future optional
changes to one attachment type only, e.g. adding expiration field to asset issue
attachment without having to add a new transaction type.

This release will cause a reset of testnet, deleting most recent blocks and
transactions.
