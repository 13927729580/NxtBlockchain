New features, testnet only:

Digital goods store.

New http API calls for creating transactions: 
dgsListing, dgsDelisting, dgsPriceChange, dgsQuantityChange, dgsPurchase,
dgsDelivery, dgsRefund, dgsFeedback

New http API calls for quering DGS:
getDGSGood, getDGSGoods, getDGSPurchase, getDGSPurchases, getDGSPendingPurchases

Goods and notes exchanged between buyer and seller are encrypted with AES, and
gzip compressed before encryption. Maximum allowed digital goods size is 10240
bytes after compression and encryption.

Alias transfer.

New http API calls: sellAlias, buyAlias

Alias sale can be restricted to a specific buyer, or open to anyone. Alias sale
with price 0 is treated as immediate transfer and doesn't require a separate buy
alias transaction. To change the ask price, submit a new sellAlias transaction.
To cancel a sale, submit a new sellAlias transaction to yourself with price 0.

Buy alias transaction can only be placed if the alias is already for sale. It is
not currently possible to just bid on an alias that is not for sale.

Encrypted messages.
AES encrypted messages are now supported in the core, so there is no need to use
externally encrypted arbitrary messages anymore. Use arbitrary messages only for
plain text, encrypted messages for confidential messaging.

New APIs: sendEncryptedNote and readEncryptedNote. Max message length is 1000
bytes, after compression and encryption.

New http API calls: encryptTo/decryptFrom can be used for encrypting and
decrypting arbitrary text to/from an account. But those just do the encryption
and decryption, don't actually send messages between accounts.

New rsConvert http query for converting account number to RS format and back.

New getBlockId API to get blockId for a given height.

Improved logging, to handle the case when Nxt is embedded as a library.

Minor improvements: getState and getBlockchainStatus now also show application
name, block JSON also shows generatorPublickKey.

Updated jetty to version 9.2.1.
