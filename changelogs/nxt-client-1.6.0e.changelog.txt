This is an experimental release for the Voting System and Phasing. It enables
these features on testnet, and is a required update for all testnet nodes.

Offline transaction signing support
The purpose of this security feature is to allow users to sign transactions without ever entering their passphrase on a workstation connected to the internet,
thus avoid the risk of their passphrase being stolen by locally installed malware such as key loggers or copy/paste loggers.
As prerequisite to using this feature, users should prepare two workstations (1) online with up to date blockchain (2) offline with Java and NXT installed
but without internet connection and optionally without up to date blockchain.
In addition you should prepare a web camera to scan QR codes and or a USB stick to copy data between the workstations.

The following procedure should be followed:
On the online workstation - users submit transactions without entering their passphrase, with the existing "Do Not Broadcast" option checked,
and with the new "Do Not Sign" option checked. To make sure this is followed, when "Do Not Sign" is checked, the passphrase field is emptied and disabled. 
The account submitting the transaction must have a public key. 
In response the server returns the unsigned transaction JSON and in case there are no encrypted messages, also the unsigned transaction bytes.
The client now displays the "Raw Transaction Details" modal with the unsigned transaction JSON and the unsigned transaction bytes, if exists.
The unsigned transaction bytes does not include the prunable attachments, however they can be used for signing the transaction and for broadcasting 
the transaction in case no prunable attachments exist.
You can pass the unsigned transaction bytes to the offline workstation by scanning a QR code or you can copy the unsigned transaction JSON to a file
and copy it to the offline workstation.
On the offline workstation - users should use the new "Transaction JSON Operations" modal "Sign Transaction" tab, to sign the offline transaction. 
In response a signature field is provided with a QR code in addition to the signed transaction JSON which users can save to a file.
Alternatively users can use the nxt.tools.SignTransactionJSON or nxt.tools.SignTransactions to perform the signing offline.
Back on the online workstation - users can scan the signature QR code into the "Raw Transaction Details" modal signature field and broadcast the transaction.
Alternatively they can use the "Broadcast Transaction" tab of the "Transaction JSON Operations" modal to broadcast the transaction JSON copied from the offline 
workstation.
