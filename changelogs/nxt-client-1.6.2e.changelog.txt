The account ledger now uses transaction id as event id for all events except
block generation. To apply this change, the account ledger table will be
automatically truncated on upgrade to this release. Users who desire to
restore the deleted past account ledger entries should run a full rescan from
the API test page. Note that account ledger records are only kept for 30000
blocks by default.

Added currency transfers history page to the Monetary System UI.

Added includeAssetInfo or includeCurrencyInfo parameters, default false, to
the getAccountAssets, getAccountCurrencies, getAccountExchangeRequests,
getExpectedAssetTransfers, and getExpectedCurrencyTransfers APIs.

Tabs are now sorted mostly alphabetically on the API test page.

Added nxt.hideErrorDetails property, default false, to allow suppressing node
specific configuration details in error messages returned to peers.

Increased default prunable lifetime setting to 90 days. Minimum enforced is
still 2 weeks.

The UPnP connection timeouts are now also configurable in nxt.properties.

Updated Bouncy Castle library to version 1.53, Jetty to version 9.3.5, IzPack
installer to 5.0.5, and weupnp to 0.1.4. Make sure to delete the old lib
folder if unpacking over a previous installation.
