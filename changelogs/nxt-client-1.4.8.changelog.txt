Removed some validations and logic no longer needed after the Monetary System
block.

Added a checkpoint at block 330000.

Various minor UI bugfixes.

Improvements in translations handling, documented in DEVELOPERS-GUIDE.md.

Better validation of hallmarks for peers with multiple addresses. Do not
blacklist peers with invalid hallmarks but just treat them as not hallmarked.

Blacklist peers with versions older than 1.4.

As more than 720 blocks have passed since the MS block, nodes older than 1.4
are now on a fork that will not be resolved by itself. To fix that, upgrading
such nodes from a version older than 1.4 to this release will cause deletion
and full download of the blockchain.
