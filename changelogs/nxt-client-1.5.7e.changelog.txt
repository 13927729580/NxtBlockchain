This is an experimental release. It is a required update for all testnet nodes,
but is also possible to run on main net.

Added file upload using multipart form requests to the UploadTaggedData,
ExtendTaggedData and VerifyTaggedData APIs. Added upload file button to the
corresponding forms on the /test page.

Added DownloadTaggedData API, to download tagged data as a file.

Added optional includeData boolean parameter to all GetTaggedData APIs, default
true, to allow omitting the actual data from the result for saving bandwith,
since it can now be retrieved separately using the DownloadTaggedData API.

Improved search by tags. Improved validation of tagged data.

Added includeEffectiveBalance to getAccount and getBalance API, default true.
If false, effective balance and guaranteed balance are not included in the
response, which should improve performance for these APIs.

Added HexConvert utility API.

Improved GetConstants JSON to include an alternative transaction type JSON
representation.

Peers in the nxt.wellKnownPeers list are always kept connected, regardless of
the number of connected public peers or the total number of know peers.


Client UI improvements:

Implemented client side signing of the tagged data transactions.

Added File Upload form, accessible from the settings menu. Allow extending a
tagged data transaction from the transaction info modal.
