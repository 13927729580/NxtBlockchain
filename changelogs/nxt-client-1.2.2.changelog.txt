Added encrypt-to-self message attachment type. Any transaction can optionally
have such an attachment, intended to be used for private notes that only the
transaction sender can read.

Added nxt.offline property. If set to true in nxt.properties, peer networking
will not start, no peers will be loaded from the database, and no outgoing
connections will be made.
