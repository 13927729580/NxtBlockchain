Added detectMimeType utility API, allowing autodetection of the mime type of
uploaded file or data, using the Apache Tika library.

The uploadTaggedData API now uses such mime type autodetection to determine
the mime type of uploaded data when the user has not explicitly provided a
type parameter. It also automatically sets the isText property to true for
data of type text/plain only.
