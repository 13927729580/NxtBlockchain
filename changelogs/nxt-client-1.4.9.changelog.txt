Added second row of info boxes on Dashboard, other UI improvements.

Password protect the Debug APIs. The nxt.enableDebugAPI property is no longer
used. Instead, the debug APIs which allow direct manipulation of the blockchain
database are always enabled, but are now protected with a password, which needs
to be set in the nxt.adminPassword property. Password is not required when the
API server is listening on the localhost interface only (the default).
The password protection can be disabled by setting nxt.disableAdminPassword=true.

MintWorker improvements. Added nxt.mint.stopOnError property, default false, to
allow continuing minting even after an error occurred.

Minting transactions are now signed locally and sent to the server using the
broadcastTransaction API. Thus the secretPhrase for the minting account is never
sent to the server, and the server or the connection to it do not need to be
trusted. The secretPhrase is also not logged to the log output anymore.

Some refactoring to allow creation and signing of transactions using the Java API
even in the complete absence of blockchain data, as needed for the MintWorker.

Minor peer networking improvement, addPeers and processBlock requests are now
executed in the background.
