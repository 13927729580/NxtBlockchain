Allow disabling of specific API or groups of API using the nxt.disabledAPI and
nxt.disabledAPITags properties, each taking a list of API request names, or API
tag names, separated with ';'. For example:

nxt.disabledAPI=startForging; startShuffler
nxt.disabledAPITags=Create Transaction; Tagged Data

will disable the startForging and startShuffler API, and all API that are listed
under the Create Transaction or Tagged Data tabs on the API test page.

Performance optimizations. Account public keys are now cached in memory. This
cache currently takes around 12 MB at most, and can be disabled by setting
nxt.enablePublicKeyCache=false.

Back button added to the transaction info, account info and block info modals,
use the back button to return to the previous info modal.
