Allow disabling of specific API or groups of API using the nxt.disabledAPIs and
nxt.disabledAPITags properties, each taking a list of API request names, or API
tag names, separated with ';'. For example:

nxt.disabledAPIs=startForging; startShuffler
nxt.disabledAPITags=Create Transaction; Tagged Data

will disable the startForging and startShuffler API, and all API that are listed
under the Create Transaction or Tagged Data tabs on the API test page.

The enabled/disabled status of each API or APITag is exposed in getConstants.

Randomize shuffling transaction timestamps. To prevent timestamp correlation
attacks, the shufflers now use random transaction timestamps, ranging from the
last block timestamp up to current time + 15 s.

Performance optimizations. Account public keys are now cached in memory. This
cache currently takes around 12 MB at most, and can be disabled by setting
nxt.enablePublicKeyCache=false.

Back button added to the transaction info, account info and block info modals,
use the back button to return to the previous info modal.

Updated H2 to version 1.4.190. The MVStore storage engine is disabled by default
as it is still in beta, PageStore continues to be used. As this version no
longer accepts implicitly relative jdbc URLs, if you have configured a custom db
location in nxt.properties, make sure to prefix the path with ./ if it is not
absolute, e.g. nxt.dbUrl=jdbc:h2:./nxt_db/nxt... instead of
nxt.dbUrl=jdbc:h2:nxt_db/nxt... . If unpacking on top of existing installation,
delete the old lib folder first.
