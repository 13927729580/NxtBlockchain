Aliases http API cleanup. There are only two API requests to get aliases now:

getAlias
parameters: either "aliasName" (the alias name) or "alias" (the alias id)
returns: full Alias JSON

getAliases
parameters: "timestamp" (optional timestamp) and "account" (the account id, 
required)
returns: list of aliases (full JSON) owned by the account, optionally filtered
by timestamp

The old getAliasId, getAliasIds, getAliasURI and listAccountAliases have been
removed as they are redundant and the new requests return all necessary info.

assignAlias has been renamed to setAlias, with "aliasName" and "aliasURI"
parameters.
