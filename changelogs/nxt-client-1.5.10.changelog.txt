Create installer package for Windows and Linux using the IzPack installer.

Database performance improvements and optimizations.

Track and log database query execution times. The new properties:
nxt.statementLogThreshold, nxt.transactionLogThreshold, and
nxt.transactionLogInterval can be used to configure logging of slow queries.

Improved JSON encoding performance.

Outbound websockets connections are no longer initiated when using a socks or
http proxy (if system property socksProxyHost or http.proxyHost is defined).

Include expired prunable JSON in API transaction JSON, if available.

To protect public nodes from unneeded extra load, the getState API does not
include counts even if includeCounts=true, unless the adminPassword is either
provided as a parameter, or is not needed.

Added separate linux and windows build and release scripts.

Updated jetty to version 9.2.11. If unpacking on top of existing installation,
delete the old lib folder first.
