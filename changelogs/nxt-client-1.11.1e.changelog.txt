Updated Jetty to version 9.3.14 and H2 to version 1.4.193, delete the
old lib folder before unpacking on top.

Updated localization component i18next to version 3.4.4

Implemented "Store Remembered Passphrase" setting in the device settings page.
When checked, the client stores the remembered passphrase in the local browser
settings or mobile app settings so that the next time the client is launched
it will login in automatically.
For the mobile app this setting defaults to true. In other configurations it 
defaults to false. The stored passphrase is deleted when logging out of the
wallet.

Desktop Application now supports request confirmations when running as light or
roaming client.

Sign Transaction modal now signs the transaction bytes on the client side.

When the mobile app cannot connect to a randomly selected remote node, it will
popup the device settings modal to allow the user to configure a specific node.

When the mobile device is offline, the device settings modal allows signing
transactions and generating tokens to support cold storage functionality.

Additional client side bug fixes and refactoring.
