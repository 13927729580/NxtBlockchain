### Branching Model ###

  - [Vincent Driessen's Branching Model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
  - **tl;dr:**
    - master is release branch
    - develop is maintained by Jean-Luc
    - feature/abc is yours

### Design ###

  - better think twice than code twice
  - communicate with community and us

### Implementation ###

  - Coding Style
